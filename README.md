<h1>TypeScript Basics</h1>
This is a comprehensive overview of basic TypeScript concepts and features. Below are the topics covered, along with their definitions:

<h2>1. Basic Types</h2>
Primitive Types: Includes number, string, and boolean. Used to represent simple data types.
Arrays: A collection of elements of the same type.
Tuples: An array with fixed types and positions for its elements.
Enums: A way to define a set of named constants.
Special Types: Any, Unknown, Void, Null, Undefined, Never.
<hr>
<h2>2. Type Inference and Annotations</h2>
Type Inference: When TypeScript automatically infers the type of a variable.
Type Annotations: Explicitly specifying the type of a variable using a colon :.
<hr>
<h2>3. Interfaces and Type Aliases</h2>
Interfaces: Used to define the structure or shape of an object.
Extending Interfaces: Allows one interface to inherit from another.
Type Aliases: Provides a shorthand name for a type.
Intersection Types: Combines multiple types into one.
<hr>
<h2>4. Classes and Objects</h2>
Class Definition: Blueprint for creating objects.
Constructors: Special methods for initializing class objects.
Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected modifiers control the visibility of properties/methods.
Readonly Properties: Ensures a property cannot be modified after initialization.
Optional Properties: Properties that are not mandatory.
Parameter Properties: Declares and initializes class properties directly in the constructor.
Getter and Setters: Used to define how properties are accessed or set.
Static Members: Properties or methods that belong to the class rather than any instance.
Abstract Classes and Methods: Used as a base class with unimplemented methods for subclasses.
<hr>
<h2>5. Functions</h2>
Function Types: Specifies the types of inputs and outputs for a function.
Optional and Default Parameters: Parameters that are either optional or have default values.
Rest Parameters: Allows functions to accept any number of arguments.
Overloads: Enables a function to handle different sets of parameters.
<hr>
<h2>6. Generics</h2>
Generic Functions: Functions that work with any data type.
Generic Interfaces: Interfaces that can be reused with different types.
Generic Classes: Classes designed to work with different data types.
<hr>
<h2>7. Modules</h2>
Exporting and Importing Modules: Enables code sharing across files.
Default Exports: Simplifies importing a module by specifying a default export.
<hr>
<h2>8. Type Guards and Utility Types</h2>
Type Guards: Checks and narrows down the type of a value using typeof or instanceof.
Utility Types: Predefined types such as Partial, Required, and Readonly to manipulate object types.
